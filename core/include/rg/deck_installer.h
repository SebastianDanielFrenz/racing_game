// rg/deck_installer.h - road deck collision bodies, built off the simulation thread (S1, design 5.2 option B).
//
// physics_sim R2 (d1f40ad): ps::World::create_shape(ShapeDesc) is const and callable from ANY thread, also while a
// step runs, and returns a ref-counted ShapeHandle; ps::World::create_body(desc, handle) on the sim thread between
// steps is O(1) in the shape size (48k-triangle deck: 6.4 us vs 22.4 ms) and bit-identical to create_body(desc).
//
// DeckInstaller owns a few plain std::threads (never ps::jobs workers: create_shape allocates, which a job would
// count as a debug_alloc violation) that convert a RoadDeck's mesh to a ps::MeshShape and build its handle. The sim
// thread calls update() between ticks:
//
//   * every REQUIRED deck is queued for building (and every PREFETCH deck: decks soon to be required, so the build
//     is done by the time the car gets there);
//   * required decks are installed in the FIXED order the caller passes them in ((way_id, start, end)), never in
//     builder-completion order - BodyIds, and with them the Jolt solver order and World::state_hash, follow that
//     order only. The order is strict: a required deck whose shape is not ready yet holds back every later one, and
//     update() returns false (the Session freezes the clock) until all required decks are installed;
//   * at most `budget` decks are installed per call.
//
// A deck whose mesh Jolt rejects fails on its worker (stderr once, counted) and is treated as done without a body.
//
// Threading: update()/bodies()/stats() on the sim (stepping) thread only. The installer must be destroyed before the
// World it was given (the workers call World::create_shape); the handles it hands to bodies may outlive both.
